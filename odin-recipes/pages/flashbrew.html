            The idea with this coffee is to brew as you usually do however instead of all hot water you are halving the water and using ice for the other half.
            This produces an iced coffee that will still have the more subtle, fruity, floral, etc. notes of a regular brewed coffee but now is in an iced form.
            Also because the ice is considered part of the water in the brewing process the coffee will not be diluted as if you added ice cubes to a regularly brewed coffee.
