            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Flip steak every 15 seconds or so until done
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from pan and let steak rest at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Salting the steak the night before allows the steak to dry out as well as absorb salt into meat seasoning it.
            Starting the steak in a cold pan with no oil allows the steaks fat to render which the steak will cook itself in.
            Flipping the steak every 15 seconds will cook the steak faster, preventing the outside from burning.
